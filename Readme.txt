. Then she asked me the logic of 2 questions:

i) Finding second largest element in an array

ii) Number of sub-arrays with sum equal to k


There are 2 questions asked, and you have 30 mins. The difficulty level is easy. 1 out of 2 questions is enough to go to the next round. Questions are like Armstrong number, power of 2, max and min in the array, etc.
